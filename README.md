# PopularMovies
Movies/TV Browsing App

Here is a fully functional and colorful android app which I made from scratch for Android Developer Nanodegree 1 program.
This app provides the user with a comprehensive list of Movies and TV shows based on various categories and genres.

*Popular Movies* was highly evaluated by certified Udacity code reviewer and was graded as "Exceeds Specifications".

## Features

With the app, you can:
* Discover the most popular, the most rated or the highest rated movies
* Discover the most popular, the most rated or the highest rated TV series
* Bookmark favourite movies/TV serials for offline view.
* Watch trailers
* Read reviews

## Design

This app uses [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API to retrieve movies.
You must provide your own API key in order to make API requests.
